Hello and Welcome to this Repo
you are invited to look into other peoples code here
just ask me to join this org via dm on **discord** or **wechat** (qr is at the bottom) or via ***github*** dm
**(if you just fool around you will be kicked)**

The main goals are
- to help people to better their code
    - please leave helpful suggestion and don't nitpick
- to help people that can't figure out how to solve a secific problem
    - leaving comments in your code can help people
    - this is not in particular to show of so please explain cool tricks you are using
    - explaining how to solve the problem itself rather just comment how you code is valueable too
- Having people that can look over your code and comment to help you get even better

Here are some guidliness for submissions
- please stick to this file structure or create poll to change
```
Language
    Problem
        Username
            sourcecode (+ markdown optional)
```
- please submit only working code or mark in it in sourcecode filename
- if you have a problem feel free to share it with people in the discord (invite was given out) in #java-ist-auch-nur-eine-insel (a link to github or pastebin.com is always better than posting `code` in the *discord* :sweat: )

Happy coding :smile:
